This codebase represents the analysis for the research  
"Automated Cellular Detection in Histopathological Breast Cancer Images."

The primary code is "reconstruction.py", which performs cell detection on 
breast cancer cell images. Plotting of relevant data can be performed by 
toggling the variable plot_bool (at the bottom of the code).
